I would like someone to build a version of https://shootingpeople.org for "projects" instead of films. A project can be anything: album, film, book, etc.

Shooting People connects you with thousands of filmmakers, actors, crew, technologists and industry to get films made and seen.
Learn what Shooting People can do for you.

Seems to consists of job ads, blog posts, members listing and discussions by members.

Codename: Build

Features:
- Submit a project
- Browse submitted projects
- View a particular project in detail
- Join a project
- Discuss and collaborate with others in your project. Kind of like a subreddit or a forum.

Thoughts
- Sounds like a social network. Different people's images will probably be on every page on the site
- Needs to be low-friction. No projects, no interest from people. No interest from people, no projects. Will need something to prime the app with activity.

New Visitor's flow
- Hit's the home page
- Sees a short blurb on top explaining what this site is all about
- Then sees a list of projects
- If they see something of interest, they can decide to lurk and just view what's going on with the project anonymously
- If they'd like to contribute, either to an existing project or create their own, they have to sign up.
- Sign up should be dead simple; enter email/password and probably fb and other types of logins.
- Let people "like" a project onto facebook or tweet it. Project gets visibility, and the site get visibility.
